 * Email verification on its own, exercised through the app UI:
 *
 *   register form  ->  API sends the code over SMTP  ->  read it from the inbox
 *   ->  enter it on /verify  ->  app confirms and redirects to the dashboard.
 *
 * The broader journey (logout, login, password reset) lives in auth-flow.spec.ts.
 * Requires the backend stack running and a test inbox (E2E_IMAP_*); skips
 * cleanly when the inbox creds are absent — see tests/e2e/README.md.
